## What This Project Does

Ever wonder what emotion someone is expressing in their text message? This app helps you find out!

Simply type any text and instantly see if it expresses **Joy** üòÇ, **Fear** üò®, or **Anger** üò°.

Perfect for:

- Understanding the mood in messages
- Learning about text analysis
- Seeing how NLP can read emotions
- Practicing with machine learning


## How It Works

**Simply enter your text:**

- Type any message or comment
- Choose from example texts to test
- Get instant emotion prediction
- See confidence scores for each emotion
- Visual chart showing probability breakdown
- High/medium/low confidence indicator


## Key Features

- **Instant Analysis** - Get results in under 1 second
- **High Accuracy** - 94% correct emotion detection
- **Visual Results** - Beautiful charts show confidence levels
- **Example Texts** - Try pre-written samples to see how it works
- **Mobile Friendly** - Works perfectly on phones and tablets
- **No Registration** - Start using immediately, no signup required


## The Machine Learning Model

**Performance:**

- **94% accuracy** - Correctly identifies emotions 94 out of 100 times
- Trained on **5,937 real text messages**
- Cross-validated with **91.7% ¬± 2.1%** reliability

**How it works:**

- **Text Preprocessing** - Cleans and prepares your text using spaCy
- **TF-IDF Analysis** - Converts words into numerical features
- **Random Forest** - Uses 100+ decision trees for prediction
- **Confidence Scoring** - Shows how certain the prediction is

**What it analyzes:**

- Individual words and their emotional weight
- Word combinations (phrases like "really excited")
- Text patterns and structure
- Emotional intensity indicators


## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Streamlit** - Interactive web application framework
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **spaCy** - Text processing and preprocessing
- **TF-IDF** - Text feature extraction technique
- **Random Forest** - Ensemble learning algorithm
- **Plotly** - Interactive data visualizations
- **Render** - Cloud deployment platform

## Model Development Process

**1. Data Exploration**

- Started with 5,937 emotion-labeled text samples
- Balanced dataset: 2,000 joy, 2,000 anger, 1,937 fear messages
- Analyzed text patterns and emotional word usage

**2. Text Preprocessing**

- Removed stop words and punctuation using spaCy
- Applied lemmatization to standardize word forms
- Achieved 3% accuracy improvement through preprocessing

**3. Feature Engineering**

- Tested different n-gram combinations (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams)
- Compared Count Vectorizer vs TF-IDF approaches
- Found optimal combination: TF-IDF + unigrams and bigrams

**4. Model Training**

- Compared Random Forest vs Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Random Forest achieved 94% vs 86% for Naive Bayes
- Validated reliability with 5-fold cross-validation


## Performance Metrics

| Emotion | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Joy üòÇ | 94% | 95% | 95% | 400 |
| Fear üò® | 92% | 94% | 93% | 388 |
| Anger üò° | 94% | 91% | 93% | 400 |
| **Overall** | **94%** | **94%** | **94%** | **1,188** |

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
